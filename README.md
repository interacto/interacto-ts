# Interacto

The TypeScript implementation of [Interacto](https://github.com/interacto).

**Interacto** is a front-end framework for processing user interface events.<br/>
With **Interacto** developers handle user interactions (DnD, drag-lock, double-click, button click, pan, multi-touch, etc.) instead of low-level UI events.<br>
Developers configure how to turn a selected user interaction into a (undoable) UI command using a fluent API.<br/>
Interacto also provides a native support for undo/redo operations.

See [https://interacto.github.io](https://interacto.github.io) for usages and documentation.
